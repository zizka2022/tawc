/**
 * Generic "copy app-shipped files into a rootfs" engine.
 *
 * Replaces the per-feature one-offs (the old [LibhybrisLinker]'s
 * symlink dance, etc.) with a single uniform mechanism that:
 *
 *  - Asks every registered [TawcInstallProvider] for a manifest of
 *    files it wants in the rootfs, given the install's method key.
 *  - Copies / symlinks each entry into the rootfs's actual on-disk
 *    tree (NOT a bind mount — entries become per-rootfs-owned files,
 *    so a misbehaving rootfs can't corrupt the source).
 *
 *  - Records the manifest in [Installation.tawcInstalls] alongside
 *    a [Installation.tawcStamp] tag.
 *
 * Whole app-owned dirs (`/usr/lib/{hybris,mesa-zink,gfxstream}`) are
 * NOT copied under [TawcrootMethod] — [TawcrootMethod.assetBinds]
 * binds them in read-only instead, so a tawcroot manifest holds only
 * the files that must coexist with distro-managed siblings (plus
 * ando / bashrc). proot and chroot still get full copies. See
 * notes/installation.md "Copy vs bind".
 *
 * The stamp is whatever [CompositorService.currentExtractStamp]
 * returns — a `versionCode + lastUpdateTime` pair that bumps on every
 * `adb install -r` (so dev iteration triggers re-installs cleanly,
 * not just version-code bumps).
 *
 * Two trigger sites — see [installInto] kdoc:
 *   1. [Installer.install] at the end of CONFIGURING (fresh install).
 *   2. [me.phie.tawc.TawcApplication.onCreate] (APK upgrade detection
 *      via per-rootfs stamp comparison; idempotent no-op when the
 *      rootfs is already up to date).
 *
 * Not called from [InstallationMethod.startInside] — enumerating
 * entries walks whole asset trees and shouldn't run on every shell
 * invocation. ([TawcrootMethod.assetBinds] does call the far cheaper
 * `ensure*Extracted` helpers per spawn, since tawcroot needs its bind
 * sources to exist; that's a stamp read, not a tree walk.)
