# tawcroot — path translation

## Path translation

The core of the value-add. For each syscall that takes a path, we:

1. Read the path string out of the guest address space through the
   guarded guest-copy helpers, bounded by `PATH_MAX`.
2. Decide if it needs translation:
   - Absolute path inside our rootfs view? → rewrite.
   - Absolute path that matches a bind-mount prefix? → rewrite to
     the bind source.
   - Relative path? → resolve relative to the kernel cwd (for
     `AT_FDCWD`) or the supplied `dirfd`, reverse-translate that base
     into the guest view, then canonicalize inside that root/bind view.
     Do **not** blindly pass relative paths through.
3. Construct the translated, canonicalized path in a per-call stack
   buffer.
4. Issue the *at-flavoured equivalent of the syscall via the stub,
   passing our rootfs fd as `dirfd` and the translated suffix as the
   path. Almost every modern Linux syscall has an `*at` form; for
   the few that don't (e.g. `chroot`), we open + fchdir/fchmod/etc.
5. Return the syscall's return value (positive or `-errno`).

We don't write back into the tracee's memory — the syscall is
*emulated*, not forwarded. The guest never sees the translated
path, only the result. This sidesteps the whole class of bugs proot
has around "the tracee modifies the path buffer between argument-
read and syscall-entry."

### Translation rules

The ordering matters. First reduce the guest request to a
guest-absolute path:

- If the syscall path is absolute, use it as-is.
- If the syscall path is relative and `dirfd == AT_FDCWD`, call raw
  `getcwd`, reverse-translate the returned host path into a guest path,
  then append the relative path. The kernel cwd is the source of truth;
  tawcroot does not keep a mutable cwd cache in the MVP. If `getcwd`
  fails because the cwd was unlinked, return the kernel-like error for
  now; add an fd-based cwd tracker only if a real workload needs
  deleted-cwd compatibility.
- If the syscall path is relative and `dirfd` is a guest fd, resolve
  the fd's current location through `/proc/self/fd/<dirfd>` (or a
  lightweight fd table if we add one later), reverse-translate that
  host path into a guest prefix, then append the relative path. If the
  fd does not map back into the rootfs/bind view, return `-ENOENT` or
  the kernel-equivalent error rather than leaking host paths.

This fd-relative resolution needs fd provenance, not just string
translation. MVP may use `/proc/self/fd/<dirfd>` for ordinary
directory fds, but the architecture must keep room for a small fd table
that records whether an fd came from the rootfs, a bind source,
`/proc`, or outside the guest view. That same table is also needed for
`fstat`, `fchown`, `fchmod`, `fchdir`, deleted-directory behavior, and
internal fd protection. Anonymous fds and fds outside the guest view
should not be reverse-translated into host paths.

Then apply these rules to the guest-absolute path `P`:

1. **`/proc` self-magic.** `/proc/self/<x>` and `/proc/<pid>/<x>`
   for our own pid (any of our tids, optional `task/<tid>/`
   segment), readlink side: `exe` is synthesized from the stashed
   original guest-requested exec path (see §"`/proc/self/exe`" —
   the kernel's view points at libtawcroot.so after our exec
   dance); `cwd` is reverse-translated through the same
   longest-prefix walk as `getcwd` (outside-view cwd → -ENOENT,
   same no-host-leak stance); `root` passes through — we never
   kernel-chroot, so the kernel's "/" answer already matches what
   a guest expects, emulated chroot included. Other `/proc`
   entries — and ALL of another process's — pass through unchanged
   (see §"Accepted syscall-fidelity divergences").

2. **Bind-mount longest-prefix match.** If `P` starts with a bound
   `dst`, rewrite to `<src><P after dst>` and resolve from the
   bind's pre-opened fd via the `*at` form.

3. **Default rootfs.** Everything else: strip the leading `/` and
   resolve relative to the rootfs fd via the `*at` form.

4. **`..` and symlink escapes are blocked for both absolute and
   relative requests.** Without intervention, the kernel's `*at`
   resolution walks `..` through real on-disk directories — so a
   guest path like `/etc/../../host-secret` would escape our rootfs
   view, since we aren't actually `chroot()`ing. The same is true
   for relative paths and for absolute symlink targets reached while
   resolving a relative path.

   We block this via **in-handler path resolution**, but it must be
   parameterized by syscall semantics. There is no single
   "canonicalize path" behavior that is correct for all syscalls:

   - **Follow-final** (`open` without `O_NOFOLLOW`, `stat`, `access`,
     `chmod`, `chdir`, exec target): resolve every component including
     the final component, follow symlinks via `readlinkat`, treat
     absolute symlink targets as guest-absolute paths, and clamp `..`
     at the selected root/bind boundary.
   - **No-follow-final** (`lstat`, `readlink`, `open(O_NOFOLLOW)`,
     `fstatat(..., AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)`, `fchownat(...,
     AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)`): resolve parent components only; the final
     component is passed through as a leaf and must not be followed.
   - **Parent-for-create** (`mkdir`, `mknod`, `symlink` destination,
     `open(O_CREAT)` when the file does not exist): resolve and clamp
     the parent directory, but do not require the leaf to exist and do
     not follow a non-existent leaf.
   - **Parent-for-remove/rename** (`unlink`, `rmdir`, `rename`
     destination): resolve the parent and preserve the leaf operation's
     kernel semantics (`unlink` removes the symlink itself; `rmdir`
     requires a directory; `rename` has its own overwrite rules).
   - **Two-path operations** (`link`, `linkat`, `rename`, `renameat2`):
     resolve each operand with its own mode. Source and destination may
     use different selected roots/binds; reject cross-root cases only
     where the host syscall or our compatibility fallback cannot model
     the guest-visible behavior.

   The resolver returns a selected base fd plus a root-relative suffix
   and a mode-specific leaf decision. The syscall handler, not the
   generic resolver, decides which host syscall and flags to issue.
   This avoids bugs like following the target of `readlink`, resolving
   the source string of `symlink(2)`, or converting `lstat` into
   `stat`.

   **Trailing-slash semantics ride on top of the modes.** The kernel
   treats leftover bytes after the final component (`/` runs, `/.`)
   as "follow the final symlink, require a directory" — even under
   `O_NOFOLLOW`/`AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` — while parent-mode ops keep
   the leaf verbatim and apply the slash to it (`unlink("l/")` →
   ENOTDIR, `mkdir("l/")` → EEXIST). The lexical fold erases those
   bytes, so translate detects them on the raw guest string
   (`has_trailing_dir_marker`, path_orchestrate.c), upgrades the
   leaf walk from NOFOLLOW to FOLLOW (keeping absolute targets
   clamped by the resolver), and re-appends one `/` to the final
   suffix so the kernel-side syscall enforces the directory
   requirement with its native errno shapes.

   **`AT_EMPTY_PATH` on plain `openat` is NOT a portable shortcut.**
   It only landed in kernel 6.6 (`openat2` got it earlier, but plain
   `openat(dirfd, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH, ...)` returns `-ENOENT` on
   anything older). When the translated suffix is empty (guest asked
   for "/"), pass `"."` instead — that resolves to the dir `dirfd`
   refers to and works on every kernel we target. For `chdir`, just
   `fchdir(base_fd)` directly when the suffix is empty. For
   `*statat`/`readlinkat`/etc the flag is well-supported and fine.
   (Confirmed empirically on Android 16 / kernel 6.6 emulator.)

   **No `openat2(RESOLVE_IN_ROOT)` shortcut.** An earlier design
   conditionally used `openat2` with `RESOLVE_IN_ROOT` inside
   `handle_openat` on kernel ≥ 5.6 to let the kernel re-root
   absolute symlink targets at `base_fd`. That broke cross-bind
   absolute symlinks: when `base_fd` is a bind src dirfd, an
   absolute symlink target (e.g. Android's `/system/lib64/libc.so
   → /apex/com.android.runtime/lib64/bionic/libc.so`) gets
   re-rooted at the bind src instead of the host root, so
   `<bind_src>/apex/...` is opened, fails with `ENOENT`, and the
   guest sees "library not found". Specifically: this silently
   broke libhybris's bionic-libc load on Pixel 10 Pro Fold (kernel
   ≥ 5.6) while older devices like the Pixel 4a (kernel 4.14, no
   `openat2`) worked. The manual resolver is now the single
   contract regardless of kernel version, and `handle_openat`
   always uses plain `tawc_openat`. Regression test:
   `prod_rootfs_cross_bind_abs_symlink` in
   `tests/integration/test_prod_rootfs.c`.

   This is not a security boundary — see §"What it explicitly is
   not" — but it stops accidental escapes (build scripts, config
   files, tarball extraction with relative paths) from silently
   reaching host content, which is a *correctness* concern even
   for a trusted guest. proot does the same canonicalize-and-clamp;
   we want feature parity.

   **Symlink-aware canonicalization cost.** Modern glibc rootfs
   has `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/bin`, `/sbin` as symlinks (typically
   into `/usr`); ld.so opens libraries through these on every
   program startup. Naively each `openat` does several
   `readlinkat`s walking the symlink chain. **Memoize the
   canonical form of well-known directory paths at init**
   (`/lib`, `/lib64`, `/usr/lib`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc` is the
   typical hit set), so the per-syscall canonicalization cost
   stays near zero on the hot path. This memoization is essential
   for performance — it's not optional. The cache has no
   invalidation — if rootfs symlinks change mid-session (e.g.
   `pacman` replaces `/lib`), the stale entry will silently
   misdirect opens. Acceptable for now: these symlinks are
   effectively immutable in ALARM. If it bites, invalidate on
   `symlinkat`/`rename`/`unlinkat` of cached prefixes.

### DAC override

tawcroot fakes uid 0, but the kernel sees the app uid on every real
syscall and `untrusted_app` never holds CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE. A mode that
denies the **owner** therefore denied the guest's "root" too: with
`/` at 0555, `mkdir /test` was EACCES (upstream #12) and `[ -w / ]`
answered no. Nothing else was wrong — `chown` needs CAP_CHOWN we never
have, so the whole rootfs is app-owned and mode is the only lever; and
`chmod` needs only ownership, so guest root can set a restrictive mode
itself and only the *next* write fails. proot's `-0` emulated the
capability eagerly (`fake_id0`'s HOST_PATH hook chmods every path
component to u+rw, plus u+x for directories, before the syscall and
restores at syscall exit), so this was a regression from the proot
install method, not a distro property.

We emulate it the same way, but only on the error path — the happy
path must not pay proot's per-syscall stat walk.

- **One wrapper at the dispatch call site** (`rescue.c`,
  `tawcroot_dispatch_call`), not a retry per handler: unlinkat,
  renameat2, linkat and openat are multi-step, so "retry the raw
  syscall" doesn't fit them, and an EACCES can come from a link-store
  operation on a route the handler never exposed. Instead the
  translator drops every route it produces (`base_fd` + suffix) into a
  per-thread rescue slot the wrapper owns, via
  `tawcroot_rescue_note()` at the single exit of
  `tawcroot_path_translate` plus the one dirfd-passthrough branch in
  `translate_local`. New path handlers are covered without touching
  `rescue.c`.
- **What gets widened.** Each route's base fd (through
  `fchmodat(fd, ".")` — base fds are O_PATH, where `fchmod` is EBADF),
  then each path prefix. Only inodes the app owns (`st_uid` == real
  uid): directories lacking `u+rwx` get them; the leaf gets `u+rw`
  only when it is a regular file **and** the syscall actually touches
  the leaf's own permissions (open, truncate, access, chdir, chroot,
  exec, utimensat, the path xattr calls — the table in
  `rescue_needs_leaf`). unlink, mkdir, mknod, symlink, link and rename
  need the parent only; widening their leaf is wasted work and the
  by-path restore would then miss, because the name is gone or moved.
- **Never chmod through a symlink.** Leaves are symlinks under the
  NOFOLLOW ops and every emulated hardlink name is a
  `tawcroot:link:<token>` symlink, while `fchmodat` has no
  `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`. The walk stats `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` and
  touches nothing that is not a directory or a regular file.
- **Never add x to a file.** That is CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE's own rule:
  root cannot exec a file with no execute bit, and `access(X_OK)` on
  one is EACCES for root too. The exec handler's "no x bit → EACCES"
  check (`exec_handler.c`) stays.
- **Retry only if the walk found an app-owned component** — not "only
  if something was widened". A concurrent rescuer may have widened the
  same directory already, and skipping the re-run would turn that race
  into a spurious EACCES. A denial we cannot own (SELinux, a bind into
  `/dev` or `/sdcard`) finds nothing and returns the original EACCES
  with no second handler run.
- **Restore, do not widen permanently**, deepest first (restoring a
  parent that loses its search bit before its child would strand the
  child). The guest keeps seeing the mode it set, so `pacman -Qkk`,
  sudo's 0440 sudoers check and ssh StrictModes stay clean. A crash
  between widen and restore leaves the wider mode; harmless.
- **Gated on virtual euid 0**, read only on the EACCES path. A guest
  that dropped privileges gets the real EACCES, matching the
  fchmodat/fchownat gating below — and every other trap avoids the
  identity seqlock read.
- **Handlers that never return to the wrapper** must restore first.
  execve/execveat call `tawcroot_rescue_restore()` before `tawcroot_exec_handler_commit()`,
  which `execveat`s away. `--exec-child` then re-opens the guest
  binary (and its PT_INTERP / shebang interpreters) **by path** in a
  fresh process, outside any dispatch wrapper, so `loader_exec.c` uses
  `tawcroot_rescue_open_in_view()` — without it a `--x--x--x` binary
  (a 4111 sudo) that `handle_execve` just rescued would fail again on
  the far side of the re-exec.
- **Re-running a handler that hit EACCES partway is safe.** The
  link-store mutations are the only multi-syscall ones; every error
  path in `linkstore.c` clears the intent slot and unlocks before
  returning, and the design is monotone (count >= live referrers), so
  a replay costs at worst a +1 overcount — already documented as safe
  in notes/tawcroot/link-emulation.md.

Fixed caps, all degrading to "no rescue" (the pre-rescue behaviour)
rather than to a wrong answer: 64 concurrently-rescuable threads, 2
routes per call (linkat/renameat translate two paths; nothing
translates more), 1024 bytes per route, 40 widened inodes per call.

Known limits:

- **No owner search bit.** The symlink walker propagates EACCES from
  `readlinkat` (`path_resolve.c`), so a directory the app cannot
  *search* fails inside translation, before a complete route exists —
  nothing to rescue. Directories with x but no w (the `/` case, and
  the ALARM bootstrap's 0500 `/etc/ca-certificates/extracted/cadir`)
  are the only ones seen in practice.
- **Renaming a directory across parents** needs `w` on the directory
  itself (the `..` update). Rename does not widen leaves, so a u-w
  directory still fails to move. Not seen in practice; fixing it means
  restoring at the destination route.
- **Races**, the same ones proot has: two processes rescuing the same
  directory can still give one a spurious EACCES (the first restores
  before the second's re-run), a restore can clobber a concurrent
  guest chmod of the same inode, and other threads briefly see the
  wide mode. Acceptable — the rootfs is one security principal
  (notes/tawcroot/overview.md).
- **Group/other-only execute bits.** Root's `X_OK`/exec on a file
  whose only x bits are group or other stays EACCES: the owner bits
  decide for the app uid.
- A **fork from a multi-threaded guest** leaves any sibling thread's
  in-flight slot claimed in the child (clone is not trapped, so the
  fork never happens inside the wrapper). Bounded, self-healing on tid
  reuse, and a full table only means no rescue.

Rejected alternative: clamping modes at chmod/mkdir/open time so the
tree never holds a restrictive owner mode. It changes what the guest
sees, does not fix modes already on disk, does not cover the faithful
0500 cadir, and diverges from proot's semantics.

### Which syscalls need trapping

The minimal set that covers our usage. Numbers are arch-specific;
the dispatch table is generated from a syscall list at build time.

**Virtual identity and metadata (stateful, like proot's `fake_id0`):**

Identity is a tracked process-wide struct (`identity.c`:
`tawc_identity` — r/e/s/fs uid+gid plus a 32-entry supplementary-group
shadow), initialised to root (all 0, groups `{0}`), guarded by a
seqlock (the signal-shadow pattern: fixed-size state + atomic sequence
counter; multi-writer safe via CAS-claim). It exists so daemons that
drop privileges and *verify the drop* (OpenSSH `permanently_set_uid`)
behave: after a drop, restoring old ids EPERMs and the getters report
the target user. The privilege predicate everywhere is virtual
`euid == 0` — fake root has all caps, everyone else none.

- `getuid`, `geteuid`, `getgid`, `getegid`, `getresuid`, `getresgid`,
  `getgroups` → report tracked values. `getgroups` is trapped so the
  kernel doesn't leak the app's Android gids (3003/9997/…) into `id`.
- `setuid`, `setgid`, `setreuid`, `setregid`, `setresuid`,
  `setresgid`, `setfsuid`, `setfsgid`, `setgroups` → Linux semantics
  applied to the virtual state (including the setreuid saved-id update
  rule and setfsuid's return-previous-never-error contract).
  `setgroups` beyond the 32-entry shadow returns kernel-plausible
  `-ENOMEM`. There is no `seteuid` syscall; libc routes via setres*id.
- `fork` inherits identity for free (address-space copy); `execve`
  ferries it through exec_state (v4, `has_identity` + embedded
  struct), restored in `--exec-child` after supervisor init.
- `stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`, `fstatat`, `newfstatat`, `statx` →
  after the host syscall succeeds, copy the result through a local
  struct, rewrite uid/gid fields to 0 for rootfs-owned paths/fds, and
  copy the decorated result back to the guest via `copy_to_guest`.
  Host errors pass through unchanged. Decoration is NOT
  identity-aware (a dropped process still sees root-owned files and
  can still open anything the app uid can) — same divergence proot
  has; enforcement is a non-goal.
- `/proc/self/status` is NOT synthesized: its `Uid:`/`Gid:`/`Groups:`
  lines show the real app ids, diverging from the getters. Known
  divergence; nothing we target parses it for identity.
- `chown`, `lchown`, `fchown`, `fchownat` → translate paths/fds and,
  when virtual euid == 0, validate existence then return success
  without a real host `chown` (app uid cannot chown; the on-disk
  rootfs intentionally remains app-owned). When dropped, forward the
  real host syscall so genuine permission errors surface.
- `chmod`, `fchmodat` → translate and ATTEMPT the host chmod (modes
  matter inside the rootfs and normally apply for real — the app uid
  owns the files), but when virtual euid == 0 swallow a host
  `EPERM`/`EACCES` into success: root doesn't get permission errors
  from chmod. Same story as the `mknodat` device-node degradation
  below and the lazy DAC override above: where the app uid cannot do
  what root would, we either do the nearest real thing or lie in
  root's favour — never surface a privilege error the guest's
  identity says is impossible. Concrete consumer: sshd's `pty_setowner()` chmod on
  `/dev/pts/N`, which Android SELinux denies and sshd treats as fatal
  for every TTY login. Non-permission errors pass through; dropped
  processes get the real result. fd-based `fchmod` is trapped for the
  same swallow contract plus the read-only-bind stage-2 check (see
  §"Read-only binds").
- A consequence of identity-blind decoration worth knowing: after a
  drop, files the guest itself creates still stat as uid 0, so
  `test -O` / ownership checks in dropped sessions misreport.
- Out of scope: no privilege *enforcement* (identity is
  cosmetic-consistent only), no setuid-bit honoring on exec (a
  dropped process cannot re-elevate via `su`/`sudo`, same as proot),
  no capget/capset modeling beyond the euid predicate, no per-user
  NSS awareness (ids are numbers). `chroot` and `mknod` stay
  un-gated (the kernel would demand CAP_SYS_CHROOT/CAP_MKNOD): a
  dropped guest can still virtually chroot / attempt mknod. sshd's
  privsep chroot happens *before* its drop so gating isn't needed;
  revisit if a workload depends on the denial.
- Known bounded failures (same stance as the chroot globals /
  signal shadow): a vfork child calling set*id before exec corrupts
  the parent's view; a set*id from a guest signal handler that
  interrupted another set*id on the same thread would self-deadlock
  on the writer claim; an identity *reader* from such a handler —
  get*id, or any handler consulting `tawcroot_identity_euid()`
  (chmod/chown privilege gates) — spins on the odd seqlock forever;
  fork while another thread is mid-set*id leaves the child's seqlock
  odd. All require a guest signal or fork landing inside a set*id's
  few-dozen-instruction write window; no known workload does any of
  these.

**Runtime control surface (protect tawcroot's own invariants):**

- `close`, `close_range`, `dup`, `dup2`, `dup3`, `fcntl` → hide and
  protect tawcroot's reserved internal fd range; guest-visible fds
  behave normally. `close_range` is emulated over `/proc/self/fd`
  rather than re-issued (NR 436 is trapped by pre-API-34 policies).
- `rt_sigaction`, `rt_sigprocmask` → virtualize `SIGSYS` so the guest
  cannot remove or block tawcroot's real trap handler.
- `sigaltstack` → substitute undersized guest altstacks (our SIGSYS
  handler is `SA_ONSTACK`).
- `seccomp`, `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)`, relevant `prctl` seccomp queries
  → deny guest filter installation for MVP; expose only compatible
  query behavior.

**Path-bearing (rewrite path arg, switch to `*at` form):**

- `open` → `openat(AT_FDCWD, …)` is already at; the kernel `open`
  doesn't take a dirfd, so we route through `openat` with our
  rootfs fd.
- `openat` → re-`openat` with the selected root/bind fd after
  canonicalization. Absolute paths are rooted at the guest `/`;
  relative paths are first resolved against the reverse-translated
  kernel cwd or the supplied guest dirfd, then clamped inside the
  same root/bind view.
- `openat2` (kernel ≥ 5.6) — same.
- `stat`, `lstat`, `fstatat`, `newfstatat`, `statx`.
- `access`, `faccessat`, `faccessat2`.
- `chmod`, `fchmodat`.
- `chown`, `lchown`, `fchownat`.
- `mkdir`, `mkdirat`.
- `rmdir`, `unlink`, `unlinkat`.
- `symlink`, `symlinkat`.
- `link`, `linkat` — translate both paths. If the host `linkat`
  fails with `EACCES`/`EPERM` under Android app-data SELinux policy,
  emulate a FULL hardlink through the out-of-tree link store: the
  file's data moves to `distros/<id>/tawcroot/link/<token>` and every
  guest name becomes an opaque `tawcroot:link:<token>` symlink the
  resolver and NOFOLLOW handlers map back to the object — shared
  inode, live `st_nlink`, any-order unlink, crash-safe counted
  mutations. See [link-emulation.md](link-emulation.md) for the store
  format, source-detection ordering, O_TMPFILE publish, and accepted
  deviations. Directory sources are stat-checked and keep the
  kernel's own EPERM (never rename a directory away). Where the store
  cannot exist (no store path, cross-fs bind source) the pre-store v1
  fallback still applies: `renameat2(src → dst, RENAME_NOREPLACE)`
  plus a guest-absolute symlink at the old name — direction matters
  (git publishes via `link(tmp, final); unlink(tmp)`; a symlink at
  `final` would dangle after the unlink). v1 coverage:
  `hosted_linkat_fallback_*` in `test_hook_faults.c`; store coverage:
  `tests/hosted/test_linkstore*.c`.
- `rename`, `renameat`, `renameat2`.
- `readlink`, `readlinkat`.
- `truncate`.
- `chdir` — translate, open the target directory, then `fchdir` so
  the kernel's CWD matches. We intentionally do not update a separate
  guest-cwd global; later relative `AT_FDCWD` paths and `getcwd` both
  derive from the kernel cwd and reverse-translate it.
- `getcwd` — call the host, then reverse-translate (strip the
  rootfs prefix, prepend `/`, or look up a bind source and emit
  the bound destination).
- `chroot` — guest-issued chroot is interesting. proot rejects it
  or rebinds. We reject (`-EPERM`, `fake_eperm` in
  `syscalls_control.c`) and revisit if a guest actually needs to
  chroot inside the chroot.
- `pivot_root`, `mount`, `umount2`, `unshare`, `setns` — same
  `fake_eperm` denial. Trapped so they can't desync our path
  bookkeeping or tear down setup binds.
- `execve`, `execveat` — the path arg needs translation, AND the
  loader/interpreter path inside the ELF (`PT_INTERP`,
  `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`) needs to resolve correctly. The
  kernel will do that itself once we've translated the binary's
  own path, because the inner `openat` calls the kernel makes
  during `execve` go through… wait, no, the kernel issues those
  itself in kernel space, they don't go through our seccomp
  filter. Which means if `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` doesn't
  exist on the host, the exec fails. We must therefore ensure that
  ELF `PT_INTERP` paths resolve. Two options:
   - **Bind-mount approach** (proot does this for some platforms):
     pre-bind `/lib64`, `/lib`, `/usr/lib` etc. in the host so the
     kernel finds the interpreter. Awkward — leaks rootfs paths
     into the host tree.
   - **Loader injection** (proot's preferred approach): rewrite
     the `execve` to run our own loader stub which then re-execs
     with `LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS`-style indirection… no, simpler:
     read the ELF, find `PT_INTERP`, manually `mmap`+`execve` via
     the interpreter at the rootfs path. proot's loader does
     exactly this. We implement the same idea but cleaner.

  Plan: read the ELF header, extract `PT_INTERP`, translate it, then
  re-exec tawcroot as `--exec-child`. The child reinstalls the handler,
  opens the translated binary/interpreter, `mmap`s their PT_LOAD
  segments, synthesizes the initial stack/auxv, and jumps to ld.so's
  entry point without a second `execve`. See "execve handling" below.

- `mknod`, `mknodat`, `statfs` — trapped, translated, dispatched.
  `mknod`/`mknodat` route to the modern `mknodat` against
  `(base_fd, suffix)`; FIFO/socket nodes succeed on tmpfs. Char/
  block devices fail `-EPERM`/`-EACCES` in production (Android
  `untrusted_app` has no CAP_MKNOD); under virtual euid 0 the
  handler degrades a refused device mknod to an empty regular-file
  placeholder (proot's fake_id0 behaviour — postinst/makedev
  scripts proceed, opens of the fake node fail at use time), and if
  even the placeholder is refused (guest `/dev` is a host-`/dev`
  bind where the app can't create anything) swallows to bare
  success, matching the fchmodat/fchownat contract. EEXIST and
  other non-permission errors stay honest; a genuinely dropped
  identity sees the real error. `statfs` dispatches via
  `/proc/self/fd/<base_fd>/<suffix>` (no `*at` form, and `fstatfs`
  on an `O_PATH` fd is unreliable on Android-shipped 5.4 kernels).
  `fstatfs` (fd-based) stays untrapped.

- `setxattr`/`getxattr`/`listxattr`/`removexattr` and the `l*`
  symlink-NOFOLLOW variants — trapped, translated, dispatched
  through `/proc/self/fd/<base_fd>/<suffix>`. The fd-based *writers*
  (`fsetxattr`/`fremovexattr`) are trapped only for the
  read-only-bind stage-2 check (§"Read-only binds") and otherwise
  pass through raw; the fd-based readers stay untrapped — kernel
  resolution against an open fd is already correct. Most calls
  return `-EOPNOTSUPP` from Android app-private storage; the value
  of trapping is that the failure is against the guest-visible path,
  not a host-relative one.

- AF_UNIX sockaddr translation (`syscalls_socket.c`): `bind`/
  `connect`/`sendto`/`sendmsg` forward-translate a pathname
  `sun_path`; `getsockname`/`getpeername`/`accept`/`accept4`
  reverse-translate the out-param address back into the guest view.
  The `recvmsg` `msg_name` / `recvfrom` `src_addr` datagram source
  address is **deliberately not** reverse-translated: `msg_name`
  lives inside the guest msghdr, so the BPF filter can't trap
  conditionally, and `recvmsg` is the hottest receive syscall in
  the system (every Wayland/X11/dbus message) — trapping it taxes
  all guest receive traffic to cover a case with no known consumer.
  A datagram source address only carries a path when the sender
  explicitly `bind()`s a pathname socket; glibc `syslog(3)` and
  sd_notify don't. Revisit if a workload does path-addressed
  datagram request/reply (symptom: replies vanish because the
  host-path source address gets forward-translated again on the
  way back out through `sendto`).

  `sun_path` is 108 bytes including NUL, and the production install
  prefix (~45+ bytes, longer with a long distro id) is spent on every
  translated path, so forward rendering is tiered: (1) host-absolute
  `<prefix>/<suffix>` — preferred because one device combo returned
  `ENOENT` for AF_UNIX bind/connect via `/proc/self/fd/N/...` in app
  context (the pacman-key fix); (2) on overflow,
  `/proc/self/fd/<base_fd>/<suffix>` (long-lived rootfs/bind fd, no
  churn); (3) when the suffix itself is long,
  `/proc/self/fd/<parent_fd>/<leaf>` with an O_PATH fd of the leaf's
  parent. The kernel stores bind's sockaddr bytes verbatim and echoes
  them from getsockname/getpeername/accept, so `bind` *reserves* its
  tier-3 parent fd and records it in a small dedup-by-(dev,ino) table
  (`sock_parents`, 16 entries); reverse translation expands
  `/proc/self/fd/<n>/...` through the recorded fd (readlink) or the
  rootfs/bind host prefix before the usual longest-prefix walk.
  connect/sendto/sendmsg close their tier-3 fd right after the call —
  their string is never echoed back. Degradations: table
  full/reserve failure → bind still works but its getsockname shows
  the raw /proc spelling; reserved fds are CLOEXEC, so after an
  execve a stale spelling is passed through untouched (empty table)
  rather than resolved through a reused fd number. If the app-context
  `/proc` bind/connect quirk resurfaces, over-budget paths fail there
  (ENOENT instead of the old ENAMETOOLONG) — everything under-budget
  stays on tier 1; revisit with supervisor-assisted bind if a real
  workload hits it. Verified 2026-07 on the physical device from app
  context (arch rootfs): tier 2/3 bind/connect/getsockname/getpeername
  round-trips and over-budget datagram sendto all work — the
  pacman-key ENOENT quirk does not hit these `/proc` spellings there.

- `socket` (`syscalls_socket.c`): `AF_NETLINK` + `NETLINK_AUDIT`
  returns `-EPROTONOSUPPORT` — what a kernel without `CONFIG_AUDIT`
  says (netlink family present, protocol unregistered). Android
  SELinux denies the audit socket with `EACCES`, which libaudit
  consumers (Debian libpam, sshd's linux-audit support) escalate to
  hard failures: `pam_acct_mgmt` → `PAM_SYSTEM_ERR` (breaking
  `su`/`login`/sshd-with-PAM rootfs-wide) and sshd `fatal()`s on TTY
  logins. Every other family/protocol passes through.

- `mount`, `umount` — translate paths. Most will fail at the
  kernel layer; that's fine.

- `io_uring_setup` — return `-ENOSYS`. This isn't a feature we
  defer; leaving io_uring un-trapped lets the guest submit
  path-bearing SQEs (the kernel reads SQEs from app-shared
  memory, not via syscalls our filter can see) that operate on
  *host* files. Denying setup makes programs fall back to
  syscall-based I/O, which we do translate. Full interception
  is sketched in §"Open questions".

**Non-path quirks (Android's stacked filter):**

The `untrusted_app` filter on lp64 RET_TRAPs syscalls that exist on
some arches but not others (this is the issue documented in
`notes/proot.md` §"Why upstream proot doesn't work on Android
x86_64"). Concretely on x86_64: `access`, `open`, `chmod`, `chown`,
`mkdir`, `rmdir`, `unlink`, `symlink`, `link`, `rename`. We TRAP
these in our own filter too, and our handlers always rewrite to the
`*at` equivalent — which means we silently fix Android's gap as a
side effect of doing path translation. This is the cleanest version
of the kludge proot's `src/tracee/seccomp.c` carries.

On aarch64, the listed syscalls don't exist as separate numbers in
the first place — glibc routes through `*at` natively — so the
Android-filter side of this is a no-op there, but we still trap
them in our filter for safety (in case a static binary issues them
directly).

**Why we trap so few syscalls:**

The seccomp filter should be as narrow as possible. Every TRAP is a
SIGSYS round-trip, and modern programs make a *lot* of `read`,
`write`, `futex`, `epoll_wait`, `mmap`, `clock_gettime` calls. None
of those need translation. The TRAP set should be strictly:

- The path-bearing list above.
- `getcwd` (because we have to reverse-translate).
- Virtual-identity/metadata syscalls (`getuid`, `set*id`, `stat`,
  `chown`, etc.) — the stateful analogue of proot `-0`/`fake_id0`.
- Runtime-control syscalls needed to preserve tawcroot's invariants
  (`close*`/`dup*`/`fcntl` for internal fd protection,
  `rt_sigaction`/`rt_sigprocmask` for `SIGSYS`, and
  `seccomp`/`prctl` for guest filter fake-accept).
- `io_uring_setup` so path-bearing SQEs cannot bypass translation.
- Any of the Android-stacked-filter set we want to silently rewrite.

That's still a small syscall subset out of ~350. The rest stay
`RET_ALLOW`, including all the hot ones. Per-call overhead on
non-path syscalls: zero (just the kernel evaluating the BPF, which
is nanoseconds). There's no kernel knob to skip BPF evaluation on
RET_ALLOW; that nanosecond per syscall is unavoidable and far
below proot's ptrace round-trip.

**Per-fd / per-arg BPF fast-paths.** Some trapped syscalls only do
real work for a small subset of their argument values. The seccomp
filter can `RET_ALLOW` the uninteresting calls so they never hit the
handler. Today only `close` has one (a range compare on `args[0]`
against `TAWCROOT_RESERVED_FD_BASE`; landed to fix the gpgme/`closefrom`
death spiral, see history below). The same shape applies to others:

- `fcntl`: only needs handling when arg0 (fd) is at or above
  `TAWCROOT_RESERVED_FD_BASE` — `F_DUPFD`/`F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC` included,
  since the handler no longer restricts the requested minimum. Today's
  handler in `syscalls_fd.c` already encodes this discrimination
  correctly; the BPF doesn't yet, so glibc's TLS/locking, GnuTLS'
  fd-flag scrubbing, and stdlib hot paths all trap unnecessarily on
  `F_GETFD`/`F_SETFD`. The BPF block would be the same shape as
  `close`'s: one range compare on `args[0]`.

These are pure perf optimizations — add them when a workload is
measurably handler-bound on the syscall in question (count
`tawcroot_dispatch_*` invocations by syscall number under a stress
run). Mechanical extension to `tawcroot_build_filter`: same shape as
the close special case.

### execve handling in detail

This is the trickiest part of the design and the place proot has
the most accidental complexity. There are two interleaved problems:

1. **The handler doesn't survive `execve`.** Per `execve(2)`,
   caught signal dispositions are reset to `SIG_DFL` across
   `execve`. So while our seccomp filter survives (kernel state,
   inherited via `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`), the SIGSYS handler does
   not — and the default action for SIGSYS is "terminate the
   process." If we `execve` into ld.so directly, ld.so's first
   path-bearing syscall (`openat` for `libc.so.6`) traps with no
   handler installed and the program dies before main().
2. **The kernel needs to find a real on-disk dynamic linker** for
   the new program. The PT_INTERP path baked into the ELF
   (`/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`) doesn't exist on the host; we
   have to redirect it.

Approach A solves problem 1 for the *first* exec by re-exec'ing
ourselves so a fresh `--exec-child` reinstalls the handler. But
the second exec — `--exec-child` launching the actual program —
re-opens the same wound: anything that does `execve(ld.so, …)` to
hand control to the dynamic linker again clears the handler.

**The fix is to *not* `execve` into ld.so.** `--exec-child`
manually loads the binary and ld.so into its own address space
(mmap PT_LOAD segments, set up the stack with argv/envp/auxv per
the SysV ABI, jump to ld.so's entry point), proot-loader-style.
Our handler text and globals stay where they are; ld.so runs
"on top of" them in unused parts of the address space; ld.so's
syscalls (path-bearing or otherwise) keep going through our
handler because the handler is still installed. This is what
proot's `libproot-loader.so` does; we do the same dance in-process
in `--exec-child`'s code rather than via a separate ELF.

(There is no `execve`-the-second-time short-cut. We considered
`execveat`'ing into ld.so and re-installing the handler from a
small LD_PRELOAD-injected constructor, but ld.so has to make
syscalls — including path-bearing `openat` for the LD_PRELOAD
library itself — *before* any user constructor runs, so the
handler reset is fatal. Manual load is the only mechanism that
keeps the handler live.)

End-to-end flow:

```
guest:        execve("/bin/bash", argv, envp)
   │
   ▼  SIGSYS, our handler
handler:      execveat(our_binary_fd, "",
                       ["tawcroot", "--exec-child", "<NN>"],
                       envp, AT_EMPTY_PATH)
   │
   ▼  kernel runs us; seccomp filter inherited, handler is gone
--exec-child: read+close state fd, re-open rootfs fd / bind table,
              install SIGSYS
              handler, then manually load /bin/bash + its
              PT_INTERP into our address space and jump to
              ld.so's entry point — NO further execve.
   │
   ▼  in-process jump (no syscall, handler stays live)
ld.so:        opens /lib/libc.so.6 etc. via openat(AT_FDCWD, …)
              → those traps come back through our handler
              → handler translates to rootfs-relative *at calls
              → recursive case is self-healing
```

The `--exec-child` manual-load step (replaces the rejected
"execveat into ld.so" path):

1. Translate `/bin/bash` → `<rootfs>/bin/bash`.
2. Open the binary with `openat(rootfs_fd, "bin/bash", O_RDONLY)`.
3. Read the ELF header.
4. If it's dynamically linked, read `PT_INTERP` (typically
   `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` or `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1`),
   translate, and open it via the rootfs fd. For static binaries,
   skip this step.
5. `mmap` the PT_LOAD segments of binary and (if applicable)
   ld.so into the address space. Use kernel-chosen addresses
   (PIE) plus `MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE` to avoid clobbering tawcroot's
   own text/data/heap. Set permissions per segment via `mprotect`.
6. Build the SysV ABI initial stack: argv (with original argv[0]
   restored — no `--argv0` trick needed since we're not running
   ld.so as a CLI), envp (guest's verbatim), auxv (synthesize
   `AT_PHDR`, `AT_PHENT`, `AT_PHNUM`, `AT_BASE`, `AT_ENTRY`,
   `AT_EXECFN`, etc. against the binary we just loaded).
7. Set the stack pointer and jump to ld.so's entry (or the
   binary's `e_entry` for static ELFs). No syscall.

The cost of one guest `execve` is *one* host exec (the re-exec of
ourselves) plus an in-process load. The in-process load is
roughly equivalent to what the kernel's `execve` does internally,
so total wall-cost is higher than a native exec but avoids a second
host exec into ld.so. The big win is that the handler stays live with
no signal-restoration trickery.

**Argv/envp limits and the point of no return.** The exec_state
collection caps (`TAWCROOT_EXEC_STATE_MAX_ARGS` 4096 args /
`TAWCROOT_EXEC_STATE_MAX_ENV` 1024 envs / 64 KiB packed strings —
`include/exec_state.h`) are checked *before* the `execveat` commit,
so an oversized exec returns a real `-E2BIG` to the caller. Every
stage after the commit (the loader's effective-argv array, the stack
synthesizer) must accept at least what collection admitted *plus*
up to `TAWC_SHEBANG_MAX_DEPTH * 2` shebang-prepended entries —
`TAWC_EXEC_EFF_ARGV_MAX` in `include/loader_exec.h`. A smaller cap
in any post-commit stage doesn't produce an errno; it destroys the
already-committed process with a bare loader exit code and no
stderr. This bit twice (loader_stack at 1024, loader_exec's
eff_argv at ~264 — `cat *` over a few hundred files silently
no-op'd); regression tests in `test_exec_via_handler.c`
(`*_args_roundtrip`, `past_max_args_e2big_precommit`) and
`test_loader_stack.c` pin the lockstep.

This is conceptually what proot's loader does, modulo proot ships
a separate `libproot-loader.so` for ptrace-land reasons. We have
a different reason to fold loader and runtime into one binary:
we want the SIGSYS handler installed before any path-bearing
syscall fires in the new process, which means no `DT_NEEDED` libs
to load before our `_start` runs. **`libtawcroot.so` is therefore
statically linked and non-PIE** (see "Known gaps" #1 and §"Why
non-PIE") and contains both the filter/handler runtime and the
manual-load program loader — one binary, a static ET_EXEC
executable (despite the `.so` filename).

### `/proc/self/exe`

When the guest reads `/proc/self/exe`, the kernel returns the path
of whatever was actually `execve`d. With manual-load
(§"execve handling in detail") that's *libtawcroot.so itself* —
the only `execveat` between the guest's intended binary and now
was the re-exec into ourselves; ld.so was loaded by us via mmap,
not via `execve`. So `/proc/self/exe` points at
`<nativeLibraryDir>/libtawcroot.so` regardless of whether the
guest binary is static or dynamic, and it's never the path the
guest expects. Many programs assume this path is the program they
think they're running (Firefox is a notable offender; glibc's
`dlopen` also relies on it for `$ORIGIN` resolution).

The fix isn't a translation — there's no host-prefix to strip back
off — it's a *substitution*. `--exec-child` stashes the
guest-requested exec path during its init (the handler's
`execveat` replaces the process on success, so the stash can't
happen in the handler itself — it happens in the fresh
`--exec-child` process). The readlink/readlinkat handler returns
that stashed `guest_exe_path` value when it sees:

- `/proc/self/exe`
- `/proc/<our-pid>/exe`
- `/proc/<our-tid>/exe` (tids equal pids in single-threaded init,
  but a multithreaded guest will see different tids; we recognize
  any tid in our process)

proot does the same; the key insight is that the value the guest
expects is the path it *originally* asked us to execve, before any
of our rewriting.

A second, result-side substitution catches readlinks that reach the
same answer without a recognizable request path — glibc realpath's
`readlinkat(O_PATH-fd, "")` on an fd opened from `/proc/self/exe`,
and `readlink("/proc/self/fd/<n>")` on such an fd: when the kernel's
result equals libtawcroot.so's own host path, the stashed guest path
is returned instead. This check is suppressed when the *request*
named a different process's exe link (`/proc/<other-pid>/exe`):
every tawcroot guest's kernel exe is the same libtawcroot.so, so the
equality test alone would hand the *caller's* guest exe path to a
readlink of someone else's link (observed: `ls` reading bash's link
got `/usr/bin/ls`). Cross-process exe links pass the kernel bytes
through verbatim, like the rest of cross-process /proc.

For `/proc/self/exe` *opens* (e.g. `open("/proc/self/exe",
O_RDONLY)` to re-read the binary), we translate to the stashed
guest path through the normal rootfs-relative path: the open
reaches the actual binary on disk.

`execve("/proc/self/exe", …)` gets the same substitution in the
exec handler (`exec_handler.c::tawcroot_exec_handler_prepare`):
the path is swapped for the stashed guest exe path before the
probe/translate, so the guest re-execs the binary it believes it
is running instead of the kernel's link target (libtawcroot.so —
which the loader would then try to map over the running
incarnation and die with `LOADER_FAIL(68)`). Load-bearing for
busybox's standalone-shell mode (Debian's config), where ash runs
nearly every applet via exactly this re-exec; the packages
bootstrap flavor runs debootstrap under that busybox
(notes/installation.md "Bootstrap flavors"). Guarded by
`test_prod_rootfs.c::prod_rootfs_execve_proc_self_exe_is_self`.

### `/proc/<pid>/fd/<n>` reverse translation

readlink of an fd magic link returns the kernel's HOST path for the
fd's target. When the *request* path classifies as
`/proc/<pid>/fd/<n>` (any pid — sibling tawcroot processes share the
view; `self`, numeric, and `task/<tid>/` forms; the fd-relative
`readlinkat(<fd of /proc/self/fd>, "<n>")` shape `ls -l` uses is
caught via the same compose-through-dirfd step as exe/cwd), the
result is reverse-translated through the rootfs/bind longest-prefix
walk — the same one `getcwd` uses. Outside-view results
(`socket:[…]`, `pipe:[…]`, `/memfd:… (deleted)`, app-private host
files) pass through verbatim: fd links legitimately point outside
the view, so unlike `getcwd` we don't ENOENT them.

Field reproducer: Bun-compiled binaries (Claude Code's native build)
canonicalize their cwd via `open(dir)` +
`readlink(/proc/self/fd/<n>)`, got the host rootfs path back, and
died with "Can't access working directory" when the follow-up stat
of that host path translated to nothing inside the view.

### `getcwd` reverse translation

After a successful `chdir("<rootfs-rel>/foo/bar")` the kernel's CWD
is `<host-prefix>/<rootfs-rel>/foo/bar`. `getcwd` returns that. We
intercept, strip the host prefix, return the rootfs-relative form.
If the path matches a bind-source prefix, we map back to the
bind-destination.

If the host prefix doesn't match (the guest somehow `chdir`'d
outside the rootfs), we return `-ENOENT` rather than leaking host
paths. proot returns the host path unchanged in that case which is
a small info leak.

`readlink("/proc/self/cwd")` synthesizes its answer through the same
function (`tawcroot_cwd_to_guest_abs`), including the -ENOENT
outside-view stance, so the two surfaces can't drift apart.

### `/proc` magic-link containment

`/proc` is bound RW into every rootfs, and a path matching a bind
takes the early return in `tawcroot_path_translate_with_ctx` ("Bind
first … skip memo and resolver"), so the suffix reaches the kernel
with no symlink resolution at all. The kernel then resolves
`/proc/<pid>/root` to the real **host** root — tawcroot never
`chroot`s — and the guest lands anywhere on the host fs, read and
write. `cwd`, `fd/<n>` and `map_files/<n>` are the same shape. No
exploit and no resolver bug: an ordinary `open()` through a supported
bind. `..` isn't involved either — the fold collapses it before
translation, which is exactly why the fold's containment argument was
true and not sufficient.

Two mechanisms in `tawcroot_path_translate` (path.c) close it, keyed
off `tawcroot_proc_magic_link_classify` (proc_shadow.c), which shares
the pid/`task/<tid>/` grammar with the shadow classifiers:

- **Own root is rewritten, not refused.** `/proc/self/root/X` means
  `/X` to a chroot'd process, so the remainder is re-translated
  against the current root view — which is both kernel-faithful and
  in-view by construction. A bounded loop (each pass strictly
  shortens the path, so nesting unwinds); exhausting the bound is
  `-ELOOP`, never a fall-through to the kernel. `chroot(2)`
  emulation composes: the rewrite targets whatever the current root
  is. A sibling guest whose reserved rootfs fd names the same inode
  as ours counts as own root too (`shares_my_root`, proc_shadow.c):
  in a real chroot its root is ours, and PipeWire's flatpak check
  opens each client's `/proc/<pid>/root` — `-ENOENT` there made every
  rootfs client look sandboxed and hang waiting for portal permission.
- **Everything else resolves, then contains.** `readlink` exactly
  the link prefix, join the resolve-through remainder,
  `tawcroot_host_path_to_guest_abs` the result; out of view is
  `-ENOENT` — what the guest should believe about a path its world
  doesn't contain. A target that isn't an absolute path
  (`pipe:[…]`, `socket:[…]`, `anon_inode:…`) is nothing to contain
  and passes; so does an unreadable link, which keeps the kernel's
  own errno.

Both only fire when the operation acts on what the link *points at*:
the path resolves through the link, or the mode follows the leaf.
`readlink`/`lstat` of a bare link stay kernel-faithful — `readlink
/proc/self/root` still answers `/`, which is what a chroot'd process
sees.

**Our own `fd/<n>` and `map_files/<n>` are deliberately exempt.** The
guest already holds that fd, so the link grants nothing new — the
same line `translate_local` draws when it lets an out-of-view dirfd
fall through to kernel resolution ("there's nothing in our view to
escape into"). It is also what keeps `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/fd/<n>` and
process substitution working. Another process's fd links are *not*
exempt: that capability isn't ours.

Residues, all deliberate:

- **An in-view host path stays reachable through a link.** The rule
  is "can the guest name this?", and e.g. the rootfs's own host path
  names guest `/`-relative files. It is an alias for an inode the
  guest already has, not an escape (`..` can't extend it — the fold
  runs first). Read-only binds still hold: the RO stage-2 check
  (§"Read-only binds") runs on the same joined host path.
- **Cross-process `/proc/<pid>/*` reads are unchanged** — bare-link
  `readlink` still answers verbatim, per the standing stance in
  notes/tawcroot/status.md §"Known gaps".
- Containment costs one `readlink` per magic-link-prefixed path under
  the `/proc` bind. Those are rare outside `self/fd/<n>`, which is
  exempt, so the hot path is untouched.

Same stance as the rest of tawcroot: this is accident containment
with kernel-shaped errors, not a security boundary (overview.md
§"What it explicitly is not"). A guest that defeats the monitor
in-process bypasses it exactly as it bypasses everything else; kernel
enforcement is plans/tawcroot-landlock.md's territory. What it does
restore is that the *documented* per-distro properties (notes/ando.md
§"Per-distro gating", cross-distro data separation) are true of the
monitor working as written.

Tests: `hosted_proc_magic_link_classify`,
`hosted_proc_self_root_routes_to_guest_root`,
`hosted_proc_self_root_bare_link`,
`hosted_proc_other_pid_root_contained`,
`hosted_proc_cwd_link_contained`,
`hosted_proc_own_fd_links_not_contained` in
`tests/hosted/test_proc_chroot.c`.

### chroot emulation

We don't have CAP_SYS_CHROOT inside the Android app sandbox, so
`chroot(2)` can't be forwarded to the kernel. Returning `-EPERM`
(the original posture) breaks pacman 6.x's `_alpm_run_chroot`,
which calls `chroot(handle->root)` unconditionally — every
post-install scriptlet and post-transaction hook fails on a fresh
Manjaro install (~80 errors per `pacman -Syyu`); the rootfs is left
without GTK icon caches, GSettings schemas, mime caches, etc. So
we *emulate* the syscall instead.

The emulation lives in `src/chroot.c`. Per-process state that
defines "the current root view":

- `tawcroot_rootfs_fd` — O_PATH dirfd. Initially the rootfs the
  supervisor opened; replaced atomically(-ish) on each successful
  `chroot()`. The *previous* fd stays in the reserved-fd list so
  the guest can't close it; it leaks until process exit (one fd
  per chroot, capped by the typical "chroot at startup" idiom).
- `tawcroot_rootfs_host_path[+_len]` — kernel-canonical host path
  of the current root, recovered via `readlink("/proc/self/fd/<n>")`
  on the new fd. `getcwd` reverse-translation, `/proc/self/maps`
  rewriting, and the relative-path resolver all read this.
- `tawcroot_binds[]` — every bind has an `active` flag and a `dst`
  field that's stored **current-root-relative**. On chroot, each
  bind's host coordinate (`old_root_host + "/" + dst`) is checked
  against the new root: inside → strip prefix → re-anchor; sibling
  or outside → mark inactive (the src_fd stays reserved); exact
  match for the new root → mark inactive (the rootfs_fd swap
  covers it). The pure helper is
  `tawcroot_path_binds_reanchor` in `path_orchestrate.c`.
- The well-known-symlink memo cache (`g_memo` in `path.c`) gets
  rebuilt against the new rootfs_fd. Old entries memoized symlinks
  in the *outer* root and would silently route inside the chroot
  to wrong targets if not refreshed.

`tawcroot_guest_exe_path` (used to synthesize `/proc/self/exe`)
and `tawcroot_self_host_path` (host path of libtawcroot.so) are
**unchanged** by chroot. Real Linux behaves the same: the kernel's
`/proc/<pid>/exe` is fixed at exec time and survives chroot
verbatim — even if the chroot makes it unreachable inside the new
view.

Edge cases the design handles cleanly:

- **chroot("/")** (the pacman 6.x case): all path translation
  surfaces collapse to identity. binds_reanchor leaves every dst
  unchanged. The memo rebuild re-reads the same symlinks.
- **chroot to a non-existent / non-directory target**: the openat
  with `O_DIRECTORY` returns the kernel's errno; we propagate.
  No state mutates.
- **chroot through a symlink**: the path translator's symlink
  resolver runs in `FOLLOW` mode, so chroot("/foo") where /foo is
  a symlink lands at the resolved target.
- **chroot with `..` chains**: folded by `tawcroot_path_fold_absolute`;
  clamped at the *current* root before openat.
- **chroot into a bind dst**: the path translator returns the
  bind's `src_fd` as `base_fd`; openat lands at the bind src's
  host path; the canonical `/proc/self/fd/<new>` readlink picks
  that up — this is the new root. binds_reanchor sees the new
  root host path bears no relationship to any existing bind's
  composed `cur_root + "/" + dst` (the bind src lives outside
  the rootfs by construction), so every bind — including the one
  we just chrooted into — falls through to the "outside" branch
  and gets deactivated. **Limitation**: binds NESTED under the
  chrooted-into bind dst (a rare configuration: bind A at
  `usr/sub` *and* bind B at `usr/sub/inner`) are also
  deactivated rather than re-anchored to "inner". Fixing this
  would require comparing the new root host path against each
  bind src's host path in addition to the rootfs prefix; not in
  scope for current workloads.
- **Repeated chroot**: each call uses the *current* state as the
  outer root, so chroot("/usr") then chroot("/lib") inside that
  goes one level deeper. (Real chroot is not strictly nestable
  for non-root, but our emulation mirrors the kernel-permissive
  posture — same as a process with CAP_SYS_CHROOT.)
- **Kernel cwd outside the new view**: `getcwd` returns `-ENOENT`
  (existing posture for any cwd outside the rootfs view, just
  newly relevant after chroot moves the goalposts).

`pivot_root` continues to return `-EPERM`. Real pivot_root requires
two separate mounts and exchanges them; we don't model mounts at
all (binds aren't kernel mounts), so there's nothing useful to
emulate. No targeted workload hits it.


## Read-only binds

`-b SRC:DST:ro` marks a bind read-only: write-intent path
translations into it refuse with `-EROFS`. The rootfs itself and
2-field binds stay read/write. Consumers: the built-in
system-partition binds (`TawcrootMethod.bindSpecs` marks the
`LIBHYBRIS_BIND_DIRS` set `:ro` — kernel-faithful `EROFS` on dirs
that are host-RO on real Android), the APK-shipped GPU asset dirs
`TawcrootMethod.assetBinds` puts at `/usr/lib/{hybris,mesa-zink,gfxstream}`
in place of per-rootfs copies (notes/installation.md §"Copy vs
bind"), user `ExternalBind`s that expose shared storage without
trusting every guest program with deletes (planned), and the
per-bind input plans/tawcroot-landlock.md threads into
`allowed_access`.

The kernel gives no RO for free here: the bind src fd is only the
`dirfd` starting inode for `openat(dirfd, suffix, flags)` — the
resulting fd's access mode comes from the openat flags, and a real
`mount --bind -o ro` needs namespaces the app sandbox doesn't have.
So RO is emulated at the translation layer, structured so a missing
check can't happen silently:

- **One enforcement point, in pure code.** Every path-bearing
  syscall funnels through `tawcroot_path_translate_with_ctx`
  (path_orchestrate.c); the EROFS refusal lives there, once, after
  the final bind route is known (a memo/symlink walk may route into
  and back out of a bind — only the final base matters; an RW bind
  nested under an RO dst wins by longest-prefix, like an RW mount
  under an RO mount). Handlers only *declare* intent
  (`tawcroot_path_intent`, a new parameter on the translate
  functions); they never implement the refusal.
- **Fail-closed defaults.** The intent enum's zero value is WRITE,
  so a forgotten/zero-initialized intent degrades to a visible EROFS
  on RO binds, never a silent write-through. The two inherently
  mutating modes (`PARENT_CREATE`, `PARENT_REMOVE`) force write
  intent inside the orchestrator regardless of the declaration —
  mkdir/mknod/symlink-dst/unlink/rename/link-dst are covered even by
  a mislabeled call site. The residual mislabel surface
  (open-for-write, truncate, chmod, chown, utimensat, setxattr) is
  pinned by the hosted matrix in tests/hosted/test_ro_binds.c.
- **The kernel double-covers data writes.** Write-mode opens through
  RO binds are refused, so no write-mode fd into an RO bind exists;
  `write`/`mmap(PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED)`/`ftruncate`/
  `copy_file_range`/… all fail on the fd's access mode with no
  tawcroot involvement.
- **Stateless fd ground truth (stage 2).** The residue — syscalls
  that mutate *metadata* through an fd legitimately opened read-only
  through an RO bind — derives its verdict at call time: readlink
  `/proc/self/fd/<n>`, then `tawcroot_host_path_in_ro_bind`
  (longest-prefix match against RO bind srcs + the RO root). No
  taint table, nothing to propagate across dup/exec, and
  SCM_RIGHTS-passed fds are covered. Trapped/checked: `fchmod`,
  `fchown`, `utimensat(fd, NULL, …)`, `fsetxattr`, `fremovexattr` —
  all cold. Caveat: this host-path ground truth is dst-blind — the
  same host dir bound twice (once `:ro`, once RW) resolves these fd
  checks by longest-prefix then bind-table order, not by which dst
  the fd was opened through. Path-level checks are per-route and
  unaffected.
- **/proc magic links (stage 2).** A /proc bind exposes kernel magic
  links that act on *host* inodes: `fd/<n>`/`map_files/<n>` re-open
  with fresh access mode (`open("/proc/self/fd/<n>", O_RDWR)` on an
  fd opened read-only — the host mount is RW, so the kernel won't
  refuse like a real RO mount), and `cwd`/`root` resolve *through*
  to the host dir (`cd /ro-bind; > /proc/self/cwd/x`). Every
  write-intent translation whose final route is the /proc bind is
  checked in `tawcroot_path_translate` (path.c) — the impure
  production wrapper every handler translation passes through
  (fs handlers, socket bind, chroot, exec/loader), so a future call
  site can't skip it; the pure `_with_ctx` orchestrator stays
  kernel-probe-free for unit tests. It's the one check that can't
  live in the orchestrator (only the kernel knows the link
  target): match `(self|thread-self|<pid>)/(task/<tid>/)?
  (fd|map_files/<n>|cwd|root)` via `tawcroot_proc_magic_link_prefix`
  (proc_shadow.c, sharing the shadow classifiers' pid/task grammar so
  two matchers can't drift), readlink exactly the link, join the
  resolve-through remainder, and RO-prefix-check the final host path
  (so an RW bind nested under an RO src still wins).

Intent per call site: stats/readlink/getxattr/listxattr/access
without W_OK/chdir/exec/statfs/open-for-read/chroot-target and
AF_UNIX `connect`/`sendto`/`sendmsg` declare READ; everything that
mutates declares WRITE (openat via a pure flags→intent classifier,
`tawcroot_openat_intent`), except openat with O_CREAT, which
declares CREATE — refused exactly like WRITE, but exempt from the
missing-target errno fidelity below (the kernel EROFSes a create
before the leaf lookup). `bind()` keeps `PARENT_CREATE` (it
creates the socket file) while connect/sendto/sendmsg moved to
`FOLLOW`+READ — independently more kernel-faithful, since the
kernel follows a leaf symlink when connecting.

Errno/fidelity notes:

- `access(W_OK)` → EROFS (kernel behavior on RO fs; falls out of
  the intent table).
- **Missing targets of leaf-must-exist writes → ENOENT/ENOTDIR.**
  For FOLLOW/NOFOLLOW WRITE ops (chmod/chown/utimensat/truncate/
  setxattr/open-for-write/access(W_OK)) the kernel looks the target
  up *before* `mnt_want_write`, so only an existing target earns
  EROFS. On a central EROFS, `tawcroot_path_translate` (path.c)
  probes the translated path (with the walk's own follow semantics)
  and passes ENOENT / ENOTDIR through; CREATE intent and the
  PARENT_* modes skip the
  probe and keep EROFS, matching the kernel's
  write-access-before-child-lookup order for create/remove.
- `open(existing, O_RDONLY|O_CREAT)` succeeds (POSIX: the create is
  a no-op). Implemented as a single retry in `handle_openat`: on a
  central EROFS with O_CREAT-sans-O_EXCL, write-free accmode, no
  O_TRUNC, re-translate with O_CREAT dropped; a resulting ENOENT is
  rewritten to EROFS. This is the only flags special case. (A
  missing *parent* also reports EROFS instead of the kernel's
  ENOENT — accepted.)
- `statfs` ORs `ST_RDONLY` into `f_flags` when the path routed RO,
  so `df` and RO-detecting installers see the truth. `fstatfs` stays
  untrapped (known divergence): an fd into an RO bind reports RW
  even where `statfs` on the same path shows `ST_RDONLY`.
- `fchmod`/`f*xattr` on an O_PATH fd → the kernel's EBADF, not
  EROFS: the stage-2 fd check steps aside for O_PATH fds at those
  call sites (and fchown hits the fake-root success swallow, same
  as rootfs O_PATH fds). `utimensat(fd, NULL, …)` is the one
  metadata write that legitimately operates on O_PATH fds, so it
  keeps the EROFS check.
- `renameat2`: uniform EROFS when either operand lands RO (the
  kernel gives EXDEV for the cross-mount flavor; equally terminal
  for `mv`).
- **linkat source in an RO bind → EXDEV, deliberately.**
  Kernel-faithful for cross-fs RO binds (tools degrade to copy); for
  a *same-fs* RO bind the host linkat would succeed and hand out a
  rootfs-named hardlink whose content stays writable — the classic
  RO-bind-mount hardlink escape — so we diverge from kernel fidelity
  on purpose and refuse. The AT_EMPTY_PATH / `/proc/self/fd/N`
  source spellings are caught by the same host-path prefix check the
  linkstore source detection already performs. This and statfs are
  the only consumers of the translate result's `ro` bit — fidelity,
  never enforcement.
- chroot *into* an RO bind is allowed (chroot is a read), and sets
  the process-global `tawcroot_root_ro`: after the swap the whole
  root view is the bind src but routing goes through
  `tawcroot_rootfs_fd`, not the bind table. Ferried across guest
  execve in exec_state v6 (`bind_ro[]` per bind + `root_ro`).
  Chroot into an RW target clears it.

What this does NOT promise: it is accident containment with
kernel-shaped errors, same stance as the rest of tawcroot ("not a
security boundary", overview.md). In-process attacks and resolver
escape bugs bypass it exactly as they bypass containment generally —
kernel enforcement is plans/tawcroot-landlock.md's territory (grant
RO srcs read/exec rights only, keyed off the same per-bind flag).
`/proc` magic-link routes around it are handled: the same joined host
path the containment check builds feeds
`tawcroot_host_path_in_ro_bind` (§"`/proc` magic-link containment").
