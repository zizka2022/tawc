/* Guest-visible SIGSYS state shadows for syscalls_control.c.
 *
 * Two pieces of state, with different scoping:
 *
 *   - "blocked": per-thread shadow tracking whether the guest blocked
 *     SIGSYS via rt_sigprocmask. POSIX: signal masks are per-thread,
 *     and the kernel mask in uc->uc_sigmask is per-thread for free,
 *     but we deliberately strip SIGSYS from it (to keep traps coming)
 *     so the shadow has to live separately. Implemented as a fixed
 *     open-address TID-keyed table with linear probing.
 *
 *   - "action": process-global shadow of the guest's sigaction(SIGSYS).
 *     POSIX: signal dispositions are process-wide. Implemented as a
 *     seqlock-protected byte buffer.
 *
 * Both helpers are pure (no syscalls), async-signal-safe, and safe to
 * call from multiple threads concurrently. They make no allocation
 * decisions and use only __atomic_* builtins on lock-free widths
 * (a _Static_assert in the .c locks that invariant in) — usable from
 * the `-nostdlib -ffreestanding` production binary and from hosted
 * glibc unit tests without translation.
 *
