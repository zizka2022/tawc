/* /proc shadow synthesis + /proc/self path classification.
 *
 * A handful of /proc files need a synthesized stand-in before the guest
 * may open them — either because the kernel's content leaks host paths
 * the guest's world view doesn't contain (/proc/self/maps), or because
 * Android's sandbox makes the real file unreadable in a way guests
 * mishandle (/proc/sys/kernel/overflow{uid,gid}, /proc/bus/pci/devices,
 * /proc/stat, /proc/version, /proc/uptime, /proc/loadavg). See the
 * comments on each synthesizer for the per-file story. Shadows cover
 * metadata too — stat/statx/access are synthesized from the same
 * classifier, not passed to the (denied) real inode.
 *
 * Everything here is async-signal-safe (raw syscalls, no allocation
 * outside anonymous mmaps that are unmapped before return).

 * `stat /proc/stat` hit the real, SELinux-denied inode. A path that
