/* Negated-errno constants for tawcroot return values.
 *
 * tawcroot is freestanding and never links libc, so it can't pull
 * `<errno.h>` (and the values it would expose are positive — wrong
 * sign for our convention). Handlers and helpers return raw `-errno`
 * directly, the same shape the kernel hands back through SYSCALL_RET.
 *
 * Convention enforced here: every constant in this header is the
 * NEGATED value (`TAWC_EINVAL == -22`). Call sites read as
 *
 *     return TAWC_EINVAL;
 *
 * not `-TAWC_EINVAL`. This is the single source of truth — do not
 * redefine any of these inline. Add new entries here as new errnos
 * become callers' return values.
 *
 * The Linux ABI fixes these numbers across both arches we ship to,
 * so the literals are portable as written. */
