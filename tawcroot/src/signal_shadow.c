/* See include/signal_shadow.h.
 *
 * Async-signal-safe by construction: only __atomic_* builtins (which
 * we _Static_assert below are lock-free for our widths, so the
 * compiler emits inline ops, never a libgcc outline call that may
 * take a mutex). No malloc, no syscalls, no libc calls.
 *
 * # Threading model
 *
 * Per-thread "blocked" — open-address table indexed by hash(tid) %
 * N_SLOTS, linear probing. A slot has (tid, blocked); slot states are
 *
 *   tid ==  0  → empty   (probe stops, slot is claimable)
 *   tid == -1  → tombstone (probe continues, slot is reclaimable)
 *   tid  >  0  → live    (probe checks match)
 *
 * Get scans probes; if it hits a matching tid it returns the bit, if
 * it hits an empty slot it returns 0 (default unblocked), tombstones
 * are skipped, walking the whole table without a match returns 0.
 * Set scans the same way: matching tid → update bit; tombstone →
 * remember and continue (reclaim if no match found); empty → only
 * CAS-claim if blocked=1 (or claim the remembered tombstone instead);
 * end-of-table → claim tombstone if any, else report the table full.
 *
 * Single-writer-per-tid invariant: tawc_sigshadow_blocked_set is only
 * called by the trapping thread for its own tid (set from handle_rt_sigprocmask) with SIGSYS masked
 * (no SA_NODEFER). blocked_reap is the exception: it tombstones other
 * tids, but only dead ones, which have no writer left. Two writers can
 * never have the same tid in production, so the same-tid update path
 * needs no CAS — a plain atomic store is enough. Different-tid
 * concurrency is real and handled via the CAS-claim spin (for both
 * empty-slot and tombstone claims).
 *
 * Overflow handling: exit(2) isn't trapped (a thread may have
 * unmapped its own stack by then, see syscalls_control.c), so slots of
 * exited threads stay live — musl blocks every signal before exiting,
 * so they hold blocked=1. When set() finds no room it returns -1; the
 * caller reaps dead tids (blocked_reap) and retries. Still full means
 * N_SLOTS live threads have SIGSYS blocked at once; the caller traps.
 *
 * TID reuse: a new thread that gets an exited thread's tid before the
 * reap reads the stale bit until its first rt_sigprocmask. musl, glibc
 * and Go all SIG_SETMASK at thread start, which overwrites it. A thread
 * killed without exit(2) is the same case.
 *
 * Process-global sigaction — classic seqlock. Even sequence = stable,
 * odd = writer in progress. Writers CAS(seq, even, even+1) to claim,
 * publish the bytes via per-byte relaxed atomic stores, then store
 * seq=even+2 with release. Readers snapshot seq, copy via per-byte
 * relaxed atomic loads, acquire-fence, snapshot seq again, retry on
 * disagreement or odd intermediate. Per-byte atomic access on
 * g_action (rather than a plain memcpy) is what keeps this race-free
 * under the C memory model: the seqlock lets us *discard* a torn
 * read, but the load itself must still be a well-defined atomic op.
 * Multi-writer safe via the CAS-claim spin. Action size is small
 * (24/32 bytes) so the inline copy beats a pointer-publish scheme
 * that would need a slab.
 *
 * The "guest ever set sigaction" flag is omitted on purpose: an
 * unset shadow is BSS-zero, and a kernel SIG_DFL action is also all
 * zeros, so callers see the right thing without a separate bit.
