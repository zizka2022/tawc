/* See include/rescue.h.
 *
 * Async-signal-safe by construction: raw syscalls, fixed storage, no
 * allocation, no libc. The only shared state is the slot table, whose
 * ownership word is claimed with a CAS and otherwise written by the
 * owning thread alone.
 *
 * Slot lifetime. The wrapper claims a slot keyed by the trapping
 * thread's tid, and releases it when the handler returns. Two ways a
 * slot could leak:
 *   - a handler that never returns. The exec commit path calls
 *     tawcroot_rescue_restore() and then replaces the process image
 *     (fresh BSS, whole table gone).
 *   - fork. `clone` is not in the trap set, so a fork never happens
 *     *inside* the wrapper; a multi-threaded guest that forks while a
 *     sibling thread is mid-trap leaves that sibling's slot claimed in
 *     the child. Bounded (one per concurrently-trapping sibling per
 *     fork) and self-healing on tid reuse, since a claim first
 *     reclaims any slot already carrying our own tid. A full table
 *     just means no rescue for that call.
